This is the software accompanying the paper "Kernel Current Source Density Method" by Potworowski et al., Neural Computation (2012) 24, 541-575. Matlab scripts implementing the methods described in the paper have been divided into two folders depending on the dimensionality of the task.

==
2D
==
Contains scripts for analyzing two-dimensional data (recordings from planar multielectrodes). Full HTML documentation of these scripts is available in the 'doc' folder, including a tutorial.

==
1D
==
Contains scripts for analyzing one-dimensional data (recordings from laminar multielectrodes). This set of scripts is less mature. See the file 'howToCall.m' for an example. Ridge regression and cross validation have not been implemented here yet. We plan to release a more complete version soon. Write us if you need it more urgently.

==============
OTHER VARIANTS
==============
The 3D version is experimental. If you would like to get the 3D code, contact Jan Potworowski (j.potworowski@nencki.gov.pl). We plan to release it in future.
