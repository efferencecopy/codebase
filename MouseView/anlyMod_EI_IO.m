function params = anlyMod_EI_IO(params)

% the goal is to have E/I ratios for each pulse (single or train) as a
% function of pulse intensity/freq/width (all the things that can be
% interleaved)

% approach: calculate conductance trace, and peak-by-pulse for each data
% file within a "group". Figure out which ax-files correspond to
% excitation, and to inhibition. Then match the condition types accordingly
% (so that excitation and inhibition are compared for the same stimulus).
% The resulting data could be a list of stimulus conditions and a list of
% E/I ratios associated with each condition.

% remember that each channel can have a unique holding potential for E or
% I.
